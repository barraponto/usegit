# What is a branch?

<v-clicks>

A **branch** is a (linear) history of changes, represented by **commits**.

# What is a commit?

<v-clicks>

A **commit** is a snapshot of your **working tree** at some _meaningful_ moment.

The **tree** is just your files. The **working tree** is the files as they are right now.

To be _meaningful_, you must write down the _meaning_ in the **commit message**.

# Pull Request

<v-clicks>

Une **pull request** ou **merge request** est une requête pour fusionner une branche à une autre, géneralement une **feature branch** dans la **mainline branch** (aussi connu sous le nom de **trunk**).

Ce n'est pas obligatoire, mais cela permet les **code reviews**.

# Code Review

<v-clicks>

A **code review** is code-related feedback from other developers, ensuring adherence to the project standards and best practices.

It may be followed up by further development (commits) and further reviews too.

# Keeping your local project up to date

- `git stash` may be used to rewind and replay your working tree changes.
- `git fetch` downloads commits and branches, but does not touch your local branches.
- `git pull` will update a local branch to match its **upstream** version.

<!--
    We may see conflicts here (during stash).
    If they show up, branch off from earlier version and apply there.
    Leave conflict management for later, if possible.
-->
