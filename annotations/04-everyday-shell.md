Annotations for Lesson 4: Everyday Shell

Everyday shell
---
This lesson delves into practical everyday shell usage, focusing on finding files, working with streams, and shell composition.

Finding files
---
Learn how to find files using commands like `tldr ls`, `tldr find`, and `tldr tree`.
These commands assist in locating files and directories efficiently, aiding in file management.

Finding in files
---
Discover techniques for searching within files using commands like `tldr grep` and `tldr rg`.
These commands allow you to search for specific text patterns within the contents of files.

Streams
---
Understand the concept of **streams** in shell programming, including **standard input (stdin)**, **standard output (stdout)**, and **standard error (stderr)**.
Streams are fundamental for input and output operations in the command line environment.

Stream redirection
---
Learn about stream redirection techniques, such as using the **pipe (`|`)** to send output from one command as input to another.
Explore the **output (`>`)** and **append (`>>`)** operators to redirect output to files, as well as the **input (`<`)** operator for input redirection.
Also, discover the **tee** command for both output redirection and displaying content.

Composition
---
Explore shell command composition, such as counting the occurrence of specific words like "eggs" in various recipes.
By combining commands, you can achieve complex tasks and gather meaningful insights from data.
