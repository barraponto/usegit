Annotations for Lesson 5: Next Level Git

Next Level git
---
In this lesson, you'll dive into advanced concepts of Git usage, focusing on branching strategies, handling mistakes, and manipulating history.

Branching theory
---
Explore the fundamental question of **why create branches** in version control systems like Git.
Understand the benefits of isolating work, enabling collaboration, and maintaining a clean history through well-structured branches.

Branching models
---
Learn about different branching models, including **trunk based workflows**, **feature branches**, and **release branching**.
Each model has its advantages and use cases, allowing you to choose the most suitable approach for your project.

Updating your work
---
Discover techniques for updating your work and integrating changes from one branch to another.
Explore the use of `git merge` and `git rebase` to incorporate changes while keeping branches organized and commits meaningful.

Rewriting history
---
Understand the concept of rewriting Git history using `git rebase -i`.
Explore interactive rebasing to edit, squash, or reorder commits, leading to a cleaner and more organized commit history.

Owning your mistakes
---
Delve into the concept of owning mistakes in your codebase by understanding **why** something happened rather than **who** caused it.
Learn about using `git blame` to trace changes and understand the context behind each line of code.

Undoing your mistakes
---
Learn techniques to undo mistakes using `git restore` and `git revert`.
Discover how to partially revert changes using `git revert -n`, allowing for selective reversal of commits.

Timetravel your mistakes
---
Explore advanced concepts of manipulating history, such as `git amend` and `git reset`.
Understand the consequences of manipulating history, including the potential use of `git push -f` to force push changes.
