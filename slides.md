# What is Free and Open Source Software?

<v-clicks>

- Early computers software was assembled
- UNIX: portable software was shared
- BASIC: custom software tool were sold

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
  Assembled programs took years to write for a single pc.
  Rewrites for newer computers took forever and everyone hated rewriting.
  Portability was heavily sought by programmers to share software across generations of hardware.
  Basic made custom software development easier, as long as you had a runtime.
  Runtimes were at the heart of a blooming industry, so the industry closed them.
  Gates letter to hobbyists is the key development to software copyright.
