# Git Quiz: Testing Your Git Wit

Welcome to this quirky Git quiz that will tickle your funny bone while testing your Git knowledge. Let's dive in and have some nerdy laughs!

## Question 1: Text Editor Tease

1. What is the default text editor for the Bash shell with a Windows-based Git install?

   - [ ] Emacs (Because who needs simplicity, right?)
   - [ ] Vim (For those who enjoy finger acrobatics)
   - [ ] Notepad++ (For the adventurous souls who like to live on the edge)
   - [ ] Bash (It's like expecting a microwave to bake cookies)

## Question 2: Prerequisite Pranks

2. Before you install Git, which of the following prerequisite products must be present and configured on your local OS?

   - [ ] Jakarta Enterprise Edition web profile compliant server (Who even uses that in their daily life?)
   - [ ] Java Development Kit 1.8 or newer (Because we all love updating Java versions)
   - [ ] Apache Maven (For the connoisseurs of complicated build systems)
   - [ ] Nothing (The moment of truth: the secret to minimalist Git installations)

## Question 3: Configuration Comedy

3. After you install Git and prior to issuing the first commit, which two configuration properties does the tool expect to be configured?

   - [ ] username and email address (Because commits without identity are like ghost stories)
   - [ ] username and password (Because Git wants to know if you're keeping your secrets safe)
   - [ ] email address and password (Security through confusion: entering email as a password)
   - [ ] username and IP address (For the times when Git becomes your network administrator)

## Question 4: Git Scopes Shenanigans

4. Which of the following is not a Git configuration scope?

   - [ ] Local (For those who love isolation and tiny, cozy repositories)
   - [ ] User (Your personal touch to customize Git's mood)
   - [ ] System (Because Git secretly dreams of becoming an operating system)
   - [ ] Global (Because world domination starts with global configuration)

## Question 5: Git History Hilarity

5. Who is attributed with inventing Git?

   - [ ] Junio Hamano (Sounds like a name straight out of a hacker movie)
   - [ ] James Gosling (Wait, wasn't he busy with something called Java?)
   - [ ] Kohsuke Kawaguchi (Possibly a ninja who mastered version control)
   - [ ] Linus Torvalds (When in doubt, credit the creator of all things nerdy)

May your Git journey be filled with laughter and version-controlled success! ðŸš€
