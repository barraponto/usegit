## Suggestion: Adding Commitizen Command to the Course

### Explanation:

I would like to propose the addition of the `commitizen` command to the course content. Commitizen is a command-line tool that helps maintain standardized commit messages in Git repositories. It makes sure that commit messages stick to a predetermined structure, which makes it simpler for teams to comprehend the changes and follow best practices.

In software development projects, commit messages are essential because they serve as a historical record of changes made to the codebase. However, inconsistent commit messages may cause misunderstandings and make it challenging to trace changes over time. Developers can make sure that commit message forms are constant across a project by using the commitizen command.

### Benefits:

**Consistent Commit Messages**: Commitizen enforces a standardized commit message format, typically adhering to the conventional commit specification. This provides clarity and consistency to commit messages across the team and improves the overall readability of the Git history.

**Automated Formatting**: With commitizen, developers no longer need to manually format commit messages. The command presents a user-friendly interface, guiding the user through a series of questions to generate the commit message with the appropriate format. This reduces the possibility of human error and saves time.

**Project Maintainability**: Consistent commit messages make it easier to understand the purpose of each change, trace bugs, and perform efficient code reviews. By incorporating commitizen in the course, learners can gain valuable knowledge on how to maintain the project's long-term stability and facilitate collaboration within a team.

**Code Review** : During code reviews, having meaningful commit messages can provide context to reviewers, helping them better understand the changes and assess their impact on the codebase.

**Historical Understanding**: As time passes, developers might leave a project or new team members might join. Having well-documented commit messages makes it easier for newcomers to understand the project's history without needing to rely solely on the code itself.
