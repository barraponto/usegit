## Suggestion for Course Improvement

I suggest that you consider the following approach during the course:

**Do not rush through the material during a lesson**, as it does not allow learners to work on the concepts you've just covered immediately.

### Why this suggestion?

- Slowing down the pace of the course ensures that learners have time to absorb and understand the material.
 It gives learners the opportunity to apply what they've learned immediately, reinforcing their understanding.
  A more deliberate pace can lead to better retention and comprehension of the course content.

## Suggestion for Collaborative Learning

I suggest not working alone but always involving the learners by encouraging them to participate in the course, asking them to share their screens following a challenge. Too many concepts without practical application can be boring for the learners.

### Why this suggestion?

- Encouraging learner participation fosters engagement and active learning.
- Requesting screen sharing after a challenge allows learners to apply what they've learned, making it more interactive.
- Balancing theory with practical application keeps learners engaged and helps solidify their understanding.
