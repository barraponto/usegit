# New suggestion

## Mathieu RANIERI

In some Git projects using CI/CD we have to take care about the current revision of our repo. 
For example we can encouter a problem where a pipeline did not take desired revision and it can causes problems or unknowed errors.

-  git rev-parse HEAD

This command allow us to see the current git version of our local repo then we can compare with remote repo.

To be sure to have the latest repository in our CI/CD pipeline environement for example we can use both command :

- git reset --hard 
- git pull

This can remove potentially commit made by the pipeline if needed. And then be allowed to make a pull to retrieve the latest version of our repo.
