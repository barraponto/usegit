## Suggestion: Exploring GitHub Security Features

I suggest incorporating a section in the course that delves into the security features provided by GitHub. This section could cover topics like repository access controls, branch protection rules, code scanning, and vulnerability alerts. By understanding and utilizing these features, learners can ensure the security and integrity of their codebase.

### Why This Suggestion?

1. **Secure Development Practices:** Equipping developers with knowledge about GitHub's security tools empowers them to adopt secure development practices from the start.

2. **Protection Against Vulnerabilities:** Highlighting the importance of code scanning and vulnerability alerts can help developers identify and address potential security vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.

3. **Collaborative Security:** Understanding how to set up access controls and branch protection rules fosters collaboration while maintaining the security of the codebase.

4. **Industry Relevance:** GitHub's security features align with industry standards and best practices. Teaching these concepts provides learners with valuable skills applicable to professional settings.
