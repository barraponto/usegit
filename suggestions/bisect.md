# Suggestion: Using `git bisect` for Efficient Bug Tracking

## Why Use `git bisect`?

`git bisect` is a command in Git that aids in identifying the commit that introduced a bug or issue. It helps streamline the process of finding the specific commit that caused a problem, allowing developers to efficiently pinpoint and fix issues in the codebase.

### Benefits

- **Focused Debugging**: With `git bisect`, helps narrow down the problematic commit among a series of commits, saving time compared to manual inspection.
- **Efficient Issue Resolution**: Developers can quickly identify the exact moment when a bug was introduced, making it easier to understand the context and fix the issue.
- **Automated Binary Search**: The command automates the process of checking out different commits, effectively performing a binary search through the commit history.

### Practical Example

Here's how to use `git bisect` to identify a bug-inducing commit:

1. Start the bisect process:

```bash
git bisect start
```

2. Specify a good (bug-free) commit and a bad (buggy) commit:

```bash
git bisect good <good-commit>
git bisect bad <bad-commit>
```

3. Git will automatically check out a commit in the middle of the specified range.

4. Test to see if the bug is present in this commit. If it's present, mark it as bad; if not, mark it as good:
```bash
# If the bug is present
git bisect bad

# If the bug is not present
git bisect good
```

5. Git will continue checking out commits in the middle of the range based on your input.

6. Repeat the testing and marking process until Git identifies the specific commit that introduced the bug.

7. Finish the bisect process once the bug-inducing commit is found:

```bash
# If the bug is present
git bisect reset
```
