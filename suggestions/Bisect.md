Suggestion: Adding the git bisect Command to the Course

Explanation:
I'd like to propose the inclusion of the git bisect command to the course material. git bisect is a potent command-line tool specifically designed for pinpointing the exact commit that introduced a bug into a codebase. By employing a binary search approach, git bisect automates the process of hunting down the offending commit, making bug detection significantly more efficient.

In software development projects, tracing the root cause of a bug often proves tedious. Pinning down which specific change introduced an issue, especially in large repositories with a myriad of commits, can be challenging. git bisect provides a systematic solution to this challenge.

Benefits:

Efficient Bug Detection: With git bisect, the process of detecting the commit that introduced a bug becomes systematic and efficient, significantly reducing the time developers spend hunting down a bug's origin.

Ease of Use: Once the user has marked a known good commit (bug-free) and a bad commit (with the bug), git bisect takes over. It continues to halve the commit range until it pinpoints the faulty commit, guiding the user step by step.

Enhanced Code Quality: By swiftly pinpointing bugs, teams can ensure superior code quality, resulting in more stable and dependable products.

Strengthened Collaboration: When a team is equipped with effective tools to trace and address issues, it fosters collaboration. Team members can swiftly identify, discuss, and rectify problems, bolstering trust within the team.

Historical Understanding: By isolating bugs to their source commits, git bisect provides a clear view of code history, allowing developers not only to discern where a bug cropped up but also why.
