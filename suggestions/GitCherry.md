The git cherry command compares commits between two branches and displays the identifiers (hashes) of commits that exist in the development branch but have not yet been incorporated into the main branch.
This helps you quickly recognize the changes you've made that are yet to be merged into the main branch.

For instance, let's say you have a project with a main branch called "master" and a development branch called "feature."
You've made a few commits in the "feature" branch to work on a new feature. When you run git cherry master feature, Git will list the commits that are in the "feature" branch but haven't been merged into the "master" branch.
This provides a clear view of the changes that are pending integration into the main development line.

In summary, git cherry serves as a helpful tool to determine which commits have been applied to a specific branch and which ones are awaiting integration into another branch.
This is commonly used to keep track of the merging and feature development process in software projects.
