# Suggestion: Explore `git cherry` for Selective Commit Integration

## Why Use `git cherry`?

`git cherry` is a command that assists in identifying commits not yet merged into the target branch. It helps you pinpoint commits that might have been overlooked or accidentally omitted during integration.

### Benefits

- **Focused Integration**: With `git cherry`, you can strategically integrate specific commits into your target branch.
- **Avoid Duplicate Commits**: It prevents duplicate commits from being merged unintentionally.
- **Efficient Code Management**: You can make sure all relevant changes are included, avoiding incomplete integrations.

### Practical Example

The command highlights commits that are present in the source branch but not in the target branch. Here's how to use `git cherry`:

```bash
git cherry <target-branch> <source-branch>
```
